# Java-Console
Redirects System.out and System.err To a window
Must be easy to add to an existing program/project

Created originaly for Java applets running in a browser.
So a java console on the browser wasn't required anymore

AWTConsole.java is the old AWT verison
Console.java is a Swing version
